        This page has a few demos of some code that I wrote to generate Voronoi diagrams. If you're interested, you can find the code <a target="blank_" href="https://github.com/ryankaplan/gpu-voronoi">here</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        What is a Voronoi diagram? Try the demo below to find out. When you click in the left canvas, you plant a colored 'seed'. In the right canvas, every pixel takes the color of the closest seed.
      </p>

      <div id="paint-demo-container" class="demo-container">
        <canvas class="input-canvas"></canvas>
        <canvas class="output-canvas"></canvas>
      </div>

      <p>
        Here's another demo that's slightly more interactive. Move your mouse over either canvas.
      </p>

      <div id="fish-demo-container" class="demo-container">
        <canvas class="input-canvas"></canvas>
        <canvas class="output-canvas"></canvas>
      </div>

      <p>
        And below is one more example. In the left canvas there are seeds in a radial pattern overlaid on top of a photo. Each seed takes the color of the underlying pixel in the image. Move the circle to move the seeds and move the square to rotate them.
      </p>

      <div id="photo-demo-container" class="demo-container">
        <div class="input-canvas-container">
          <img id="eye" src="eye.jpg"></img>
          <canvas class="input-canvas"></canvas>
        </div>
        <canvas class="output-canvas"></canvas>
      </div>

      <p>
        In the above examples, we draw a Voronoi diagram by walking through every pixel and, for each pixel, drawing the color of the closest seed. In the demo below, we show the distance to the closest seed. A white pixel is close a seed and a dark pixel is far from a seed.
      </p>

      <div id="distance-demo-container" class="demo-container">
        <canvas class="input-canvas"></canvas>
        <canvas class="output-canvas"></canvas>
      </div>

      <p>
        And below we only draw pixels that are within some minimum distance of a seed.
      </p>

      <div id="threshold-demo-container" class="demo-container">
        <canvas class="input-canvas"></canvas>
        <canvas class="output-canvas"></canvas>
      </div>

      <h2>
        How does this work?
      </h2>

      <p>
        There's a really simple way of computing Voronoi diagrams: for every pixel in an image, look through every seed and take the color of the closest one. This gets pretty slow as you add a lot of seeds.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are a few other popular algorithms for computing Voronoi diagrams, and I won't go into all of them (<a href="http://www.alanzucconi.com/2015/02/24/to-voronoi-and-beyond/">this article</a> gives a good overview). But I was recently showed one that I thought was particularly cool. It's performance doesn't depend on how many seeds you start with - and it's well suited to running on the GPU. So it runs really fast and you can make demos that work in real time.
